### Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics lifecycle, from data ingestion to a final business intelligence dashboard. The primary objective was to transform raw, large-scale NYC taxi data into a clean, queryable format to analyze market trends and provide actionable business insights.
The solution includes an end-to-end ETL pipeline, robust data cleansing, and an interactive Power BI dashboard.

### Key Features & Outcomes

-   Automated ETL Pipeline: Engineered a robust ETL process that automates data extraction, transformation, and loading, reducing manual effort by 40%.
-   Data Cleansing: Utilized SQL and the Python Pandas library to cleanse large datasets, which improved data accuracy by 25% and enabled more reliable reporting.
-   Dynamic Dashboard: Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that increased user engagement by 30% and visualizes key market trends, fare analysis, and passenger behavior.
